hi how can i be using markdown in a good way and explore 
so i found if Im going to make a lot of notes then i have to 
store them in some palce for future refreces
therfore it should be a way that i can be freely create markdowns
or even better jupyter note books
they are awsome man jupyter notebooks are very very well man
